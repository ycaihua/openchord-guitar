### OrganizationStructure ###
A document marking organizational structure of things that need to be done for OpenChord.org

# Testing #

  * Debugging – Play the game!
  * Product Testing – Play the game!

# Hardware #

  * Enclosures - Need to look into places to buy enclosures / shapes of guitar heads..
  * Figure out a detachable connection plate? Ribbon cable?
  * SMD board - Not a current priority. Soon to be, possibly. Either send to Jim or Claire, or send to Australia...

# Marketing #

  * Videos – Need to work on soon, not immediate though...
  * Images – We could use some promotional materials, banner ads and buttons, that sort of thing for web advertising. Ryo is working on this.
  * Website - Check it out? Get feedback?

# Documentation #

  * Instructions
> > – Look over these, and figure out improvements/corrections. Also, make some sort of background so it's not so boring. Currently in OpenOffice. Find someone with Illustrator?

# New Functionality #

  * Vibralto - Claire is working on this.
  * Strumming – Super not a current priority

# Wii Work #
  * (the guitar code and the controller communication parts of the code have been separated; the new code hasn’t been tested on an actual Wii, so there’s no real guarantee that it works, at all)
  * Code checking/cleanup/refactoring – Need another set of eyes
  * Porting the code to the Arduino – Not a current priority, maybe first to work on after 1.0 release?

> Expanding to the Xbox 360. - Not a current priority
